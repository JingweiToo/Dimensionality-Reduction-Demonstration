# Simple-Dimensionality-Reduction-Demonstration
I offer the program for feature reduction (1) PCA  The "Main" script illustrates the example of how PCA can reduce the number of features using benchmark data-set. In addition, I also demo how to plot the first three components for PCA.  ********************************************************************************************************************************** Detail of PCA can be found in the following paper: [1] Too, J., Abdullah, A.R., Saad, N.M., Ali, N.M. and Zawawi, T.N.S.T., 2019. Exploring the relation between EMG pattern recognition and sampling rate using spectrogram. Journal of Electrical Engineering &amp; Technology, 14(2), pp.947-953.
